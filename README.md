# **My Awesome E-Commerce App**

This is a React-based e-commerce application that consists of two pages: the Customer Page and the Admin Page. On the Customer Page, users can view all products, add them to their shopping cart, and place orders. The orders are then sent to the backend for processing. On the Admin Page, users have the ability to analyze purchase behavior using various charts. Some of the displayed insights include the most purchased product by orders and the store with the highest revenue. Additionally, users can create a new product on the Admin Page.
